# Baking Pi

This is the code from following along with the [Baking Pi](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/index.html)
tutorial. I'm using the template to build the projects, and
[Rowley CrossWorks](http://www.rowley.co.uk/arm/index.htm) for ARM
(via 'Externally-built Executable') for development.
